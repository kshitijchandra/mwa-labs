1. Ans:
   setImmediate schedules callback to run at check phase while setImmediate schedules callback after timer phase. In the cart we can see timer phase is at top while
   check phase is after i/o operation phase. Mostly our operations are in i/o phase so check phase comes faster than timer phase usually. So, we want to use setImmediate
   rather than setTimeout sometimes.

2. Ans:
    process.nextTick is in different queue(priority) outside event loop. while setImmediate is inside event loop. So, process.nextTick always processes first than setImmediate.

3. Ans:
        Buffer, Domain, Module, Global, Http, Url, setInterval, setTimeout, Util, Path, Os, Escape, Tty, Set, WeakMap, Cluster
